# Security

This document provides guidelines on how to report security vulnerabilities in the project.

## Reporting Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow the guidelines below to report it securely and responsibly:

1. **Do not open public issues**: Please do not submit public issues or pull requests containing details of the vulnerability. This could allow others to exploit the issue before it's fixed.
   
2. **Contact**: Send an email to **sebastianjnuwu@gmail.com** or open a private ticket in the repository to report the issue. Please provide as many details as possible, including:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce it
   - Potential impact
   - Any code or examples of how the vulnerability can be exploited

3. **Acknowledgment**: All security reports will be handled with the utmost seriousness, and you will be publicly credited if the issue is resolved.

## Handling Reports

When we receive a security report, we follow this process:

1. We confirm receipt of the report within 48 hours.
2. We analyze and prioritize the vulnerability.
3. We work on fixing the issue promptly.
4. We inform the reporter when a fix is ready.
